# Practical Session 1

## Step 1: Dataset Loading 
I will use the following datasets:
- Iris Dataset (for classification) 
- California Housing Dataset (for regression) 
Load the datasets using scikit-learn. (Alternatives are still okay) 
 
## Step 2: Classification Algorithms 
Using the Iris dataset, (or any other choice) implement and test the following classification 
algorithms: 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
- Naive Bayes 
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest 

For each algorithm: 
- Train the model 
- Make predictions 
- Display the confusion matrix 
- Compute Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score 
 
## Step 3: Regression Algorithms 
Using the California Housing dataset, (alternatives are allowed) implement: 
- Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression 
- Lasso Regression 
- Ridge Regression 

For each model: 
- Train the model 
- Make predictions 
- Evaluate using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²
